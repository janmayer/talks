Reduce skill gap

ChatGPT is pretty amazing. I use it to learn and build my Django app. Is incredible how much information and definitions it can pack in a few sentences. It helped me understand how Nginx, Gunicorn, and Django should be deployed. All my JS, CSS, and HTML5 files are built with the help of ChatGPT. I don't need to google things out as often, moreover, I think I switch from 10 browser pages all at once, to about 5. That makes me extremely efficient. I doubled the amount of code I'm producing over the same period of time. ChatGPT is a big leap for our civilization. Even if is about 70% - 80% accurate, is our job to take care of the rest 20% - 30% isn't it? Let's see what wonders will this AI bring.

The way I use ChatGPT for programming is to have it write a simple example of how to use a function or library for a specific task, and then use its answer as a reference, while also double checking things using documentation or Google.

I am also a senior dev. I treat chatgpt as my very knowledgable assistant. It helps me going in the right direction. There have been many times where it pointed me to a library, or a specific method in a library or framework, which I forgot about or just hadn't used before. There have also been times when it somehow would get sort of lost and then I just resorted to googling :)

Refactor this code. Including some alternative for urllib, and strong typing with pydantic. Simplify the rest as much as possible
